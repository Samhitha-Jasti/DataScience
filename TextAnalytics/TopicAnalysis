What is Topic Analysis:

Topic analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that allows us to automatically extract meaning from text by identifying recurrent themes or topics.
It automatically assigns topic to text data. (or) Topic analysis (also called topic detection, topic modeling, or topic extraction) is a machine learning technique that organizes
and understands large collections of text data, by assigning “tags” or categories according to each individual text’s topic or theme.


Purpose of Topic Analysis:
Topic analysis uses natural language processing (NLP) to break down human language to find patterns and unlock semantic structures within texts to extract insights 
and help make data-driven decisions.

Approaches to Topic Analysis:
There are two different approaches to topic analysis:

NLP Topic modeling: used to discover the main topics within a bunch of texts
NLP Topic classification: used to automatically categorize texts by topics

The main difference between these two techniques is that one uses a supervised algorithm (topic classification), and the other an unsupervised algorithm (topic modeling).
