**So what is the difference between Normalizing and Scaling?**
Normalization adjusts the values of your numeric data to a common scale without changing the range whereas scaling shrinks or stretches the data to fit within 
a specificrange. Scaling is useful when you want to compare two different variables on equal grounds.

Min-max normalization: Guarantees all features will have the exact same scale but does not handle outliers well. Z-score normalization: Handles outliers, but does not produce normalized data with the exact same scale.
